# Experiment 26 - Ultima Tiles

In this experiment, we'll display the tile map with a player avatar in the
middle of the render area. The avatar can walk around, and a default tile will
be rendered "outside" the map. This is similar to how the old *Ultima* games
(and the new *Nox Archaist*) handle maps/movement.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

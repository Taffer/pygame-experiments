# Experiment 10 - UI Spinbox

In this experiment, we'll draw a spinbox with some text in it. It'll respond
to the mouse hovering over it, and clicks, switching between a set of values.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

or:

```sh
python main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

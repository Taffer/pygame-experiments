# Experiment 27 - Scaled Tiles

In this experiment, we'll display the tile map at double size (so 64x64 tiles
instead of the "native" 32x32) to see how the different scaling algorithms
compare. Press Space to cycle through the scaling modes.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

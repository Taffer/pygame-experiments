# Experiment 18 - Tilemap Layers

In this experiment, we'll draw a viewport onto a tilemap that was created
in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). Use the arrow keys or WASD to move
the viewport around the map. This expands on *Experiment 11* by working with
a map that has several layers.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

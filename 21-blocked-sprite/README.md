# Experiment 21 - Blocked Sprite

In this experiment, we'll take experiment *17 - Sprite Joystick* and add
some blocks that restrict movement. I was trying to do this as part of a new
lighting Experiment, but it wasn't working, so I decided to simplify a little.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

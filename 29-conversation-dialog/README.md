# Experiment 29 - Conversation Dialog

This experiment produces a "complete" conversation dialog, a hybrid between
the typical "portrait with text" JRPG style (like in Experiment #6) and the
free-form text input of something like *Ultima V* or *Nox Archaist*.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

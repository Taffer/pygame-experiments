# Experiment 8 - Styled Text

This is an attempt to create a simple text window that supports some text
styling (multiple fonts and colours). Print text to it, render it, and scroll
up when you reach the bottom.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

or:

```sh
python main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

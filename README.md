# PyGame Experiments

Some experiments using the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) game framework
and Python.

These are ports of my
[Löve experiments](https://github.com/Taffer/love-experiments/) for now, we'll
see where this goes. Lua's easy enough and fast, but I'm happier developing in
Python…

## `pycodestyle`

Note that I use the following settings for `pycodestyle` while working in
Sublime Text, your favourite editor or IDE might vary. Basically, doc comments
wrap at 80 characters, and the maximum line length is 132 characters (in homage
to þe olde terminals of yore):

```json
        "pycodestyle": {
            "args": [
                "--max-doc-length=80",
                "--max-line-length=132"
            ]
        },
```

## Bribe me

Want to bribe me to work on more experiments, faster? Want to suggest an
experiment?

Always willing to entertain suggestions, but if you're asking me to do some
work, you have the option of fuelling it with coffee. ;-)

# Experiment 28 - Map Triggers

Like in Experiment 26, we'll display the tile map with a player avatar in the
middle of the render area. Various triggers will be set off based on first
entering the map, and when stepping on certain tiles.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

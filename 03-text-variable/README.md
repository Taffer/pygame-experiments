# Experiment 3 - Variable Width Text

This is an attempt to create a simple text/console type of window. Print text
to it, render it, and scroll up when you reach the bottom. Think of the
text area in the bottom-right of the
[Ultima V](https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/File:U5amig.jpg), for example.

We'll make an area that can display five lines of about 20-ish characters each.
The text area is the same size as the monospaced experiment, but this time
we're using a variable-width font.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
./python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

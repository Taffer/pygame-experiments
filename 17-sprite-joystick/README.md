# Experiment 17 - Sprite Joystick

In this experiment, we'll take experiment *14 - Animated Sprite* and add
joystick support. Specifically for the wireless XBox gamepad I've got.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.

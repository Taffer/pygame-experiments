# Experiment 22 - Sprite Unwalkables

In this experiment, we'll combine #11 - Tilemap with #14 - Animated Sprite,
then demonstrate a viewport that tries to stay centred on the sprite, and
unwalkable tiles (aka some simple collision detection). The collision info
will also be stored on a separate map layer that doesn't get drawn.

You can run it from this directory with:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

If you're using Sublime Text:

1. Open the project.
1. Under Tools -> Build System, choose "Pygame - Main". You only need to pick
   the build system once, it's stored in the workspace file.
1. Choose Tools -> Build or press its shortcut (Ctrl+B).

Press Escape to exit the demo.
